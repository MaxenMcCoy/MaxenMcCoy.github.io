					<p>Hey, I'm Maxen McCoy! I'm a game programmer and developer working in the industry for just over 5 years. I'm always excited to work on creative projects,
					of which I always have too many.</p>
					<p>I worked as an engineer at Skymap Games from 2020 to 2025, working extensively in Unity and Unreal Engine to ship titles like
					<a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0926-CUSA16447_00-CAMOREPUBLIQUE01" class="rngTheme-color">RÃ©publique: Anniversary Edition</a> and
					<a href="https://www.airshipsyndicate.com/wayfinder" class="rngTheme-color">Wayfinder</a>.
					Before my time there, I attended Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), where I received my bachelors in game programming and development.</p>
					
					<p>Even in my free time, I still enjoy working on various little game projects. I've always been fascinated with the wide variety of skills that go into making
					a video game, which I've made an effort to explore through some of my solo projects. Some disciplines I've particularly enjoyed exploring are systems design,
					level design, tech art, VFX, sound design, and more.</p>
					
					<p>I also can never turn down a game jam! Over the years, I've participated in over 10 jams. In the competitive jams hosted at SNHU, I placed 1st or 2nd on 6
					different occasions.</p>

					<p>You can check out some of the projects I've worked on <a href="portfolio.html" class="rngTheme-color">here</a>!
					You can also find me on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/fornan.bsky.social" class="rngTheme-color">Bluesky</a>
