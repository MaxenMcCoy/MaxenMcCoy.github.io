					<h1>Triplanar Mapping</h1>
					<hr class="rngTheme-color">
					For regularly UV mapped models, your UV map is a pre-made map of 2D coordinates used to directly sample
					a texture. In triplanar mapping a 3D coordinate is converted using maths into that 2D coordinate.
					<br><br>
					<p>I will be demonstrating this using Unity and Shadergraph (in URP). Shadergraph has a built-in
					triplanar node which makes things nice and easy. All the principles here should apply to most rendering
					setups, but other softwares may not have a built-in node available. If that's the case, you'll need
					to implement your own triplanar mapping. Fortunately, there are plenty of good resources out there
					on how to do that!

					<p>An important thing to note with Shadergraph's triplanar node is that by default it does NOT work with normal maps. To make
					it work, you'll have to set the Type parameter on the triplanar node to Normal. This is because the data of a normal texture
					is represented in a different style from most other textures (direction vectors vs a set of linear values), and a slightly
					different algorithm is get the result.</p>

					<h2>Triplanar Mapping In Object Space</h2>
					<hr class="rngTheme-color">
					<p>So why is this happening? Well, by default the 3D set of coordinates that the triplanar node is using to figure out where to
					sample textures is the pixel's world space coordinate. To make the textures remain aligned with object, you'll need to calculate
					your triplanar node with your object space coordinates. Doing that is fairly easy: just hook up a position node and a normal node
					that are both set to object space to your triplanar nodes.</p>

					<p class="pt-3 px-2">And here it is with all 3 nodes hooked up! It's a bit messy here, but it's just connecting the nodes to the position

					<h2>Final Remarks</h2>
					<hr class="rngTheme-color">
					<p>Triplanar mapping is super useful for making quick and easy assets, texturing environments, or just avoiding UV mapping at all costs.
					This breakdown is pretty light and non-technical, but if you want to get into the weeds (particularly in regards to triplanar normal mapping),
					<a href="https://medium.com/@bgolus/normal-mapping-for-a-triplanar-shader-10bf39dca05a" target="_blank" class="rngTheme-color">this is a great article</a>.
					<br><br>
					There are a few issues that can crop up with triplanar mapping that I want to mention:
					<ul>
					<li>Using normal maps in object space doesn't actually work. It looks okay, but if you look closely at the above gif you can see the lighting on the boat looks a little odd sometimes. This is just because Shadergraph's normal  triplanar implementation relies on some world space data that can't be accessed. There are resources out there on how to correctly implement this if you really want, but for prototyping or doing a game jam, this can be fine.</li>
					<li>Even with using object space, you will still have issues if you use this technique on skinned mesh renderers (such as animated characters) or anywhere you have deforming meshes. In those cases you still need to use regular UV maps.</li>
					<li>Any faces of your model that aren't aligned with the grid can look blurry, depending on the texture you're using. If you use textures that have a uniform look (like the wood texture I've used in this post), you should be fine.</li>
					</ul>
					
					Further things to try out with this:
					<ul>
					<li>MinionsArt grass shader</li>
					<li>Using UVs to make decals/trimsheets (Star Citizen)</li>
					</ul></p>
