				<p>A multiplayer prototype based on the mechanics of Halo's Infection gamemode. In short, an asymmetric FPS team deathmatch, where one team starts with few team members, melee only, and unlimited lives, and the other team starts with guns and one life per player; joining the melee team on death.</p>

				<p>This project was created in about a month's time. The project was to create a small networked multiplayer game using the Photon plugin for Unity. Photon is a cloud based API for multiplayer networking. Learning how to network a game with this plugin was difficult, and required a lot of independent research to complete this project in a successful way. Considering that most of the class had many difficulties with this project, I'm very proud of how well this project came out. The actual gameplay is very much complete, with fully playable rounds with any number of players (within reason). I also had enough time to add a lobby system where you could search for or create lobbies by name, and then wait there until you and the other lobby memebers were ready to start the game. As a prototype, I think it was very successful project.</p>
